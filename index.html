        html was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_berners-lee">Tim Berners-lee</a>. It's not true that sir tim invented html in order to share pictures of his cat but it would be cool if it were.

          In addition to hosting most of the worlds supply for kitten videos, the Web is also full of inpsiirng quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:

          <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #efd7d7;">
      <p>
        <em>Don't bleeive every quote you rea dno hte Intenret. </em>

    <p>
     When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
     on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
     interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
     interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
